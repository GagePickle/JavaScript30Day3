# JavaScript30 Day 3

This repository contains the completed Day 3 challenge from the online course JavaScript30 by Wes Bos.

In this challenge css variables and filters are used to make changes to an image through the use of html input sliders. More space can be created around the image, a blur can be added to the image, and the color of the space around the image can all be changed.

The challenge has been completed in a more modern way than Wes Bos shows in his original tutorial. JavaScript modules are used to import and export functionality between files, resulting in cleaner code that is easier to make changes to. ES6 arrow functions are also used when possible in place of the function keyword.
